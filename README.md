# ideas:

learning platform:

gamified learing, progress tracking,story based learning , ability to choose paths , unique scenarios, personalized problems. 
live leaderboards, cool stats, visualizations, insights.

data harvesting , helpful learning , levels , daily challenges, intaractive quizzes, inline code helping, content recommendations.

personal space , personlized ai chatbot for students to talk with , and express their problems, professional stats for teachers and lecturers to understand student needs, strengths , weaknesses.

Dashboards for management to observe live class and student and lecturer engagement metrics.

Personality quizes to assess multiple skills of a student.

ability to choose bg music while coding.

UI:

CLEAN, modern ,asthetic ui like github blue + black combo for healty long coding sessions, game like ui during code submission , stylish ui.

smooth animations between pages , accurate stats , student stats using stylish and smoothly animated graphs, pie charts , game like skill pentagons or hexagons , levelwise progression  

profile, inventory, coins (earned by completing missons/problems), theme (code editor themes), and there should be a start button at bottem right , it should ask us to choose mode if we havent already.

modes : battle royale , clash squad (4 v 4) , lone wolf (1 v 1) , rush hour + all ranked varients. (each mode can be python or web dev)

battle royale is basically a room of 20 people (or squads or duos or singles) , where you have to solve python problems and the last person to solve gets eliminated. so on for 19 rounds.

clash squad , is 4 people writing on the same piece of code. where they can all contibute , it can be web dev or python (where they have to design fucntions to help each other)

lone wolf is basically 1 v1 to see who solves to see who can solve the problem the fastest. fastest one to solve gets a point, first to get 7 points , wins.

rush hour is basically the same as lone wolf but has harder and time taking problems and you get eliminated as soon as opponet wins.

each game should have a voting system that can allow players to choose, their concepts, for example (loops , condtionals , functions etc )

winning earns you points, and gives you crate which have a chace to drop rare loot , like hints , themes , badges etc.
